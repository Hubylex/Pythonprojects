'''Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. 
One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. 
Find these two numbers.

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {6,1,4,3,2,1}
Output: Missing = 5, Repeating = 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 1 and 
smallest positive missing number is 5.'''
